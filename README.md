# Silent Install Manager  
Just a personal "launcher" I use to quickly install things I frequently use or need to do on a VM.

This started as a way to learn scripting. \
The fisrt version was done with AutoIt, but then I rewrote everything in Python (with tkinter for the GUI).

There probably is a faster and easier way to do the same thing but like I said, I'm still learning.
