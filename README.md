# Silent Install Manager  
Just a personal "launcher" I use to quickly install things I frequently use or need to do on a VM.

This started as a way to learn scripting. \
The fisrt version was done with AutoIt, but then I rewrote everything in Python (with tkinter for the GUI).

There probably is a faster and easier way to do the same thing but like I said, I'm still learning.  

There's two differents verison. 
- 1 containing all the differents .exe. The downside is that the archive can be quite big (+1GB)
- 1 who will only download what you want to install. The downside is that an internet connexion si required
